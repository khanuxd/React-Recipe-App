# Project Name: Recipe App

A school project for the showcase of cooking recipes where the ultimate goal is to learn how to do get and post request from my own built server and showcasing the data for the users.

### My Procedures

1. Front end side is developed with ReactJS framework.
2. The backend side was supposed to develop with Symfony (a framework of PHP) which is still on process, but for the initial solution a JSON server is created and hosted in the heroku server.

### Own developed recipies API: [Server](https://recipe-json-server.herokuapp.com/recipes)

### Live Preview : [Front-End] (https://project-recipe-reactjs.netlify.app/)
